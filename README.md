# Deep-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch
Here I have implemented a deep neural network without using any libraries of Tensorflow or Keras. The implementation from
stratch is very useful to understand the steps involved in designing a end to end model which is often not understood using
the libraries. 
I have also implemented the gradient check code which is used to ensure the correct implementation of gradient updates.
