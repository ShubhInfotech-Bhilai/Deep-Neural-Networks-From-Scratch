# Deep-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch
Here I have implemented a deep neural network without using any libraries of Tensorflow or Keras. The implementation from
stratch is very useful to understand the steps involved in designing an end to end model which is often not understood using
the libraries. 
Backward_pass_utils contains all the necessary code for back propagations.
Forward_pass_utils contains all the necessary code for forward propagations.
main.py is the code that is to be run.
